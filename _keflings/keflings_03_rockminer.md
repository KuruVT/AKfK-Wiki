    The Miner Kefling is tasked with harvesting 
    <img src="https://github.com/KuruVT/akfk/blob/main/assets/images/resources/rock.png?raw=true" alt="Rock" style="vertical-align: middle; height: 1em;"> 
    by breaking boulders.<br> 
    Once a resource is depleted, the Miner Kefling will automatically move to the nearest boulder in the area to continue gathering.<br> 
    To assign a Kefling to this task, pick it up and place it on a stone resource block.<br> 
    You can also direct the Kefling to deliver rocks by placing it at a collection point, such as the Basic Workshop.<br><br>
    Miner Keflings work more efficiently if the Surveyor's Office has been built, allowing them to break boulders faster.
