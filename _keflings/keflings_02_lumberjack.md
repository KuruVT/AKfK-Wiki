    The Lumberjack Kefling is responsible for chopping trees to produce logs.<br>Once a tree is fully harvested, the Kefling will automatically move to the nearest tree in the area to continue gathering resources.<br>To assign a Kefling to this task, pick it up and place it on a tree resource block.<br>Additionally, you can direct the Kefling to deliver logs by placing it at a collection point, such as the Basic Workshop.<br>Lumberjack Keflings work more efficiently if the Saw Pit has been constructed, allowing them to chop wood faster.
