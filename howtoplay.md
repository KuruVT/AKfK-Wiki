## Gameplay Tips

### Extra Features

▶ Building a Nursery will give you access to topiaries. The Sculptor will provide you with statues to build. You can use these to customize your kingdom however you like.

▶ When you've built an Artist's Plaza, you can paint the walls and roofs of your buildings. Build the Artist's Plaza and activate it by placing a Kefling inside. Click on the Plaza, select a color, and your painter Kefling will appear to the side of the building! To paint, all you need to do is take your painter to the desired building and drop him in it. Your painter will return to the Artist's Plaza if left for a few seconds.

▶ Bored? Kick some kefling behind! Pick up a Kefling and click!

▶ Use your imagination to get even more from the game. Why not try building a maze from walls and see if your friends can get through it? Make a soccer pitch and play Kefling soccer!

### Stuck?
▶ If you are unsure what to do next, click `?` for a nod in the right direction.

### Harvesting Resources

► In order to build things you first need to gather resources. To do this, click on an unobstructed forest, stone quarry, sheep farm or crystal patch. 

HINT: Before you can harvest from sheep farms or crystal patches. you'll need to find the appropriate tool!

► The Keflings can also gather resources. Click on a Kefling to pick him up and click on the resource you want him to gather. He will start to harvest it. Once you have gathered a resource, you will need to place it in a building that accepts that type of resource. Carry a resource over to a workshop and click on the building to put it in.

HINT: Each workshop only accepts the types of resource that it uses to build. This is different for each workshop, so you need to pay attention! 

► Keflings can carry the resources they gather to a place you specify. Pick up a Kefling who is trained to harvest and put him down wherever you would like him to deliver his resources.

HINT: It you want Ketlings to carry resources to a building, be sure to place them inside the building instead of next to it.

### Transporting Resources

► Keflings can be trained to transport from a pile of resources to another location. To do this, you must first unassign them from their previous tasks. This can be done by clicking `hat` while holding a Kefling.

HINT: For example, you can use this technique to transport planks from a Lumber mill to the Town Workshop.


### Blueprints

► At any point you may view your unlocked blueprints by clicking on `bp`.
to

▶ With the Blueprints screen up, click on `i` to view detailed information about the selected blueprint. Click on the blueprint will set it as your current blueprint.

► When a building is set as your current blueprint, you can click `+` to view a simple schematic of that building in the top left of your screen.

### Activating Buildings

► To complete some buildings, you'll need to activate them. Look to the right of a blueprint to see if there are any activation requirements.

► Some buildings require educated Keflings to activate them. To educate a Kefling, place one inside a Primary School, Secondary School or Guild Hall.

HINT: Before a school can be used, you need to activate it by dropping a Textbook in it.

### Breaking Things

► If you want to move a building, you can walk up to it and click `punch` until it breaks and then move its Pieces.

HINT: You can do this to unwanted building pieces as well to use their resources for something else.

### Keep & Castle

► The Keep and the Castle are built a little differently from most other buildings. The Town Hall forms part of the Keep and the Keep forms part of the Castle. This means that to build a Keep, all you have to do is place the extra components in their relative position to the Town Hall. Once this is done, the Town Hall will transform into the Keep. The same relationship exists between the Keep and the Castle.

► There are some buildings which can be connected to the Keep and Castle using walls. When you are looking at the blueprints screen, upgrades can be distinguished by dotted lines connecting them to the Keep or Castle.

### Quests 

► Quests are given by the local Kefling in charge. This Kefling can be found at the Town Hall, Keep or Castle.

► You will be rewarded for completing quests. Rewards come in many forms, including upgrades for your giant and new blueprints.

► Clicking on the Town Square will show you which upgrades you have collected throughout the game.
